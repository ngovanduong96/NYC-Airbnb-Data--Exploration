# NYC Airbnb Market Exploration

Welcome to the NYC Airbnb Market Exploration project! This Python project aims to analyze the vibrant Airbnb market in New York City, providing valuable insights.

## Overview

The project focuses on importing and cleaning Airbnb dataset for New York City to uncover interesting patterns and trends within the market. Through this analysis, we aim to answer questions such as:

* What is the average nightly price of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
* How does the average monthly price of an Airbnb listing compare to the private rental market?
* What is the count of advertisements for private rooms?
* How do Airbnb listing prices vary across the five boroughs of NYC?

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Obtain Dataset**: Obtain the Airbnb dataset for NYC. Place the dataset file in the `data` directory in `data` folder.

4. **Run the Analysis**: Execute the Python script `data_analysis.ipynb` to start the analysis. This script will import the dataset, clean the data, and perform exploratory analysis.
